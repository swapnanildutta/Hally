**The safety of women is a global concern. Over the decades, scenarios of kidnapping as well as trafficking (irrespective of gender) are alarmingly on the rise despite different legal actions are in forced.** Woman covers almost half population of the country, so they are half participants in the growth and development of India. We are running in the 21st century, an advanced era, however it is very shameful to say about the doubtful safety of woman in India.

With advancement of tech’s, kidnappers have also become appreciably smart. The modus operandi of kidnapping have also become significantly updated. Generally, after every event of kidnapping, the victims were taken to some unknown places having unsuitable environment and the kidnappers make them captive and seek ransom or do sexual assault. And even sometimes the hostages have to cost their lives if their demands are not fulfilled.

Speaking Globally, according to a survey in 2018 by Forbes and many other trusted websites, India tops a global ranking of most dangerous countries for women.

It is well-documented that during a war, a natural disaster or a pandemic, women’s bodies bear the worse brunt of the crisis. Domestic violence against women is already widespread and under-reported in India. **Now, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations recognises domestic violence against women as a “shadow pandemic”. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a huge spike in domestic violence against women in China, Australia, France, the U.K., Spain, and Bangladesh, among others.** In India, too, the National Commission for Women has reported a large increase in distress calls from victims of domestic violence since the pandemic broke out. — [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/womens-safety-during-lockdown/article31324318.ece)

From a practical standpoint, the safety of women is at stake every time they go out at night, especially in less crowded areas and roads. Every day and every minute, some women of all walks of life (a mother, a sister, a wife, teenager girls, and even children) are getting harassed, molested, assaulted, and violated at various places all over the country. It just don’t stop here. Illegal “Human trafficking” in India remains a significant problem. People (both child and adults of both sex) are frequently illegally trafficked through India for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced/bonded labour.

Nowadays, self-defense techniques are not just enough for self-protection. A reliable, smart measure is required to ensure safety or protection from danger on the fly.

Thus we have chalked out an impressive measure to thwart such menace which would perhaps not eradicate the matter but do a great deal to that extent. Presenting **Hally** — **Her personal Ally!**
